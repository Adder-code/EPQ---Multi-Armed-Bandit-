# 🎰 Multi-Armed Bandit – EPQ Project

This repository contains my EPQ project focused on multi-armed bandit algorithms, a classic problem in reinforcement learning. I explored various strategies such as epsilon-greedy, UCB, Thompson Sampling, and hybrid decay models using Python.

## 📂 Contents

- `MABgame.py` – main simulation logic
- `actionregret.py` – regret tracking functions
- `combinedmulti.py` - combination of some solutions to compare metrics 
- `epsilonGreedyMulti.py`, `expUCB_hybrid.py`, etc. – different MAB strategies
- `README.md` – this file

## 💡 Focus

- Algorithm design and performance comparison
- Data visualisation of regret and reward over time
- Minimal UI – functionality prioritised over styling

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Practical reinforcement learning basics
- Designing simulations and metrics to compare strategy performance
- Structuring Python code across multiple algorithms
- Developed my use of libries e.g. numpy & matplotlib 


## 🔗 EPQ Write-Up 'The solutions and significance of the multi-armed bandit problem' 

The write-up can be found as EPQ-PDF.pdf in the files 
- Solid read to grasp basic understanding of the problem
- Develops on practice & real-world uses of the algorithms derived from the problem
- Covers theory behind the problem and its solutions
