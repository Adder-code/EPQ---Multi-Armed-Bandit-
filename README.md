Files containing the algorithms and pratcial explainations for MAB problem.
Admittedly, files conatin little commenting and an unclear structure. 
Main content of solutions exists within combinedmulti.py, other files contain trialed algorithms, tests and experiments for the most part. 
MABgame.py is a good gamification of the inital not contextual bandit problem. 
normaldist(...).py contains a visual of the 3D normal distributon representing the inital machines means distribution followed by thier respective action distributions.
